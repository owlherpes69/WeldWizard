Implementation Plan
The implementation will be divided into phases, starting with the essential functionalities and gradually adding more complex features.

Phase 1: Core Functionality
Database Setup

Design and set up the database schema based on the previously outlined tables.
Implement a basic data entry interface for initial setup (e.g., entering material types, labor rates, etc.).
CLI Development

Wizard Mode: Develop the interactive wizard that prompts users step-by-step to enter project details.
Form Mode: Create a form-based input system that allows users to input all data at once.
Data Processing and Cost Calculation

Develop the processing engine to calculate total costs from the input data.
Ensure accurate calculation for material costs, labor costs, equipment usage, and consumables.
Output Generation

Implement functionality to generate detailed pricing breakdowns and summaries.
Provide options to save these breakdowns in various formats (e.g., PDF, text file).
Phase 2: Enhancements and GUI Development
GUI Development

Design and develop a graphical user interface to enhance user experience.
Ensure the GUI mirrors the functionalities of the CLI, offering both wizard and form modes.
Advanced Features

Add features for historical data analysis and reporting.
Implement user accounts and permissions for multi-user environments.
Testing and Optimization

Conduct thorough testing for both the CLI and GUI versions.
Optimize the tool for performance and scalability.
Documentation and Support

Create user manuals and documentation to assist users in navigating the tool.
Set up support channels for troubleshooting and user feedback.
Milestones
Initial Database and CLI Setup - Establish basic functionalities for data management and cost calculation.
Basic Testing and Feedback - Gather feedback on the CLI version to refine functionalities.
GUI Development Completion - Launch the GUI version with full feature parity to the CLI.
