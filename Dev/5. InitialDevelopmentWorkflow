Initial Development Workflow
Set Up Development Environment

Tools and Frameworks: Install necessary development tools, frameworks, and libraries based on your chosen tech stack (e.g., Python, database systems).
Version Control: Set up version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes and collaborate if needed.
Begin Development

Database Implementation: Create the initial database schema and tables.
Core CLI Features: Develop the basic structure of the CLI, focusing on input and output handling.
Testing Phase

Initial Testing: Conduct initial unit tests for individual components.
Integration Testing: Ensure different parts of the tool work together seamlessly.
User Testing: Share early versions with a small group of users to gather feedback and identify any usability issues.
Documentation and Iteration

User Documentation: Begin drafting user manuals and help guides.
Developer Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for code and architecture.
Iterate and Refine: Use feedback and test results to refine features and fix bugs.
Preparation for GUI Development

Once the CLI version is stable and well-received, begin planning the GUI version.
UI/UX Design: Create wireframes and mockups for the graphical interface.
Technology Stack: Choose technologies for the GUI, ensuring compatibility with existing systems.
Ongoing and Future Considerations
Feature Expansion: As the tool becomes stable, consider adding advanced features such as analytics, user accounts, and cross-platform support.
Scalability: Plan for future scalability in terms of both performance and feature set.
Community and Support: If open-sourcing the project, set up a community platform for contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.
