Planning for GUI Development
Once the CLI version is stable and functional, you can start planning for the graphical user interface (GUI) version:

UI/UX Design: Develop wireframes and prototypes for the GUI, focusing on user experience.
Technology Selection: Choose appropriate tools and frameworks for building the GUI.
Integration: Plan how the GUI will interface with the existing backend and database systems.
Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
As the tool is developed and deployed, continuous monitoring and improvement will be crucial:

Performance Monitoring: Keep an eye on the tool's performance and scalability, making adjustments as necessary.
Feature Expansion: Based on user needs and feedback, plan and implement new features.
Community Engagement: If the tool is open-source, engage with the community for contributions, bug reports, and enhancements.
